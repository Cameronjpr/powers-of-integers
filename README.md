# powers-of-integers
My first real crack at python. A short script that works through a range of integers, outputting the powers of each one (up to 5). 

E.g. 
"2, 4, 8, 16, 32"
"3, 9, 27, 81, 243"
etc.

You can set the range by changing the values in parentheses e.g.(101) following the function call. 
Bear in mind that the script will only go UP to the given number -- so 101 will yield the powers of numbers 2-100*.

* I skip 0 and 1, naturally... (there must be a better way of doing this)
